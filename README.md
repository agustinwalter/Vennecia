# Vennecia

**Vennecia** is a web app to buy tickets for discos. 

We use **facial recognition** to identify our users upon entering the establishment, greatly reducing waiting times.

The project still in development. Although it has been paused, temporarily, due to COVID-19.

The web app is developed in **React JS**, using **Firebase** as database (including auth, storage and hosting services).
